[Autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) is a command line utility for quickly jumping between previously visited folders. It works by maintaining a database of the directories you use the most from the command line.

If you need to jump between folders frequently, instead of manually writing out `cd ../other-project` you could use `j oth` which would jump you to the nearest folder fuzzily matching `oth`.

Or between a couple of projects:

```bash
$ j app
$ pwd
# /Users/rixcy/Projects/my-app

$ j lib
$ pwd
# /Users/rixcy/Projects/my-library
```

## Installation

Full installation instructions can be found on the README [here](https://github.com/wting/autojump#installation). If you're on a Mac and use Homebrew you can just run `brew install autojump`.
