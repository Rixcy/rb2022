Sometimes it can be helpful to include recommendations for VSCode extensions to use with your project, this is especially handy when you use tools such as [Prettier](https://prettier.io) or [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

To do this, you can create a `.vscode/extensions.json` file at the root of your project and use the following syntax with each array entry as the identifier for a plugin.

```json
{
  "recommendations": ["esbenp.prettier-vscode", "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"]
}
```
