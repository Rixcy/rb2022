Sometimes you might want to force users to use a certain package manager like Yarn or NPM to prevent conflicting lockfiles from being created. A nice way of doing this is to use the only-allow package.

## Installation

Add a `preinstall` script to your project's `package.json`.

If you want to force **[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm)**, add:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preinstall": "npx only-allow npm"
  }
}
```

If you want to force **[pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/)**, add:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preinstall": "npx only-allow pnpm"
  }
}
```

If you want to force **[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)**, add:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preinstall": "npx only-allow yarn"
  }
}
```
